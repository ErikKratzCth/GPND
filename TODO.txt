TODO-list for GPND BDD100k novelty detection

# Understand structure of code:

train_AAE.py:

	Data is loaded in folds = dataset divided into a couple of equally sized sets (for memory usage?)

	train data is called mnist_train and is a list where each element mnist_train[i] is a tuple. 
		mnist_train[i][0] is the label, an int,
		mnist_train[i][1] is a numpy.ndarray with image pixel data, ranging [0,255]
		image data is later divided by 255, so we want pixels to range [0,1] eventually
